Maperitive Rulesets
===================

Here I work on the rulesets of [Maperitive](http://maperitive.net/).

### Rules

In this folder you can find the default rules that are included in Maperitive.

### UserRules

Here you can find rules I created on my own, rules sent to me and rules found somewhere on the net.
Some rules are taken from the [Maperitive rules category](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Category:Maperitive/Rules) of the [OpenStreetMap Wiki}(http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/).

Usage
-----

To use this rules you need to download them from here or clone this repository. Then you either drag&drop the ruleset on the Maperitive window or use the appropriate Maperitive commands.
